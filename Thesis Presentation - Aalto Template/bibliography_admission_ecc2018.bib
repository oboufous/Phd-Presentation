Based on a store-and-forward modelling of the urban network traffic and using the linear-quadratic regulator theory, the design of \{TUC\} leads to a multivariable regulator for traffic-responsive co-ordinated network-wide signal control that is particularly suitable also for saturated traffic conditions. Simulation investigations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results of TUC's first field implementation and evaluation are also presented. Finally, summarising conclusions are drawn and future work is outlined. },
